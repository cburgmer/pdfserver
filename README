Pdfserver is a Django application that offers basic PDF operations as a
webservice. It depends on pyPdf to manipulate PDFs.

Rationale
=========
Powerful tools to manipulate PDF exist but they are not universally
available on all systems or not simple to use. This server allows anyone to
quickly solve basic PDF operations over the web.

=======
See http://cburgmer.nfshost.com/pdfserver/ for an example installation.

============
* Python 2.4, http://www.python.org
* Django (tested with 1.2), http://www.djangoproject.com/
* pyPdf (tested with 1.12), http://pybrary.net/pyPdf/

Optionally
----------
* python-reportlab (tested with 2.4), 
  http://www.reportlab.com/software/opensource/rl-toolkit/
* jQuery & jQuery UI (tested with 1.8.4), http://jquery.com/
  needs at least UI core, "Sortable" and "Dialog" from jQuery UI,
  but is already built in and shipped with pdfserver

4. Make sure the given upload directory is writable and not accessible from 
   outside.

5. When not in debug mode make sure to serve static files under ``media/js/*``
   and ``media/css/*``.
