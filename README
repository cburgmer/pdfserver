Pdfserver is a Django application that offers basic PDF operations as a
webservice. It depends on pyPdf to manipulate PDFs.

Rationale
=========
Powerful tools to manipulate PDF exist but they are not universally
available on all systems or not simple to use. This server allows anyone to
quickly solve basic PDF operations over the web.

Dependencies
============
* Python 2.4, http://www.python.org
* Django (tested with 1.2), http://www.djangoproject.com/
* pyPdf (tested with 1.12), http://pybrary.net/pyPdf/
* jQuery & jQuery UI (tested with 1.8.4), http://jquery.com/
  needs at least UI core, "Sortable" and "Dialog" from jQuery UI

Features
========
- Designed to work with&without Javascript
- Joining of files
- Selecting pages & page ranges

Deploy
======
Asside from installing Python, Django and pyPdf you need to deploy the
appropriate files from JQuery and jQueryUI. Run the following to download
and copy the files::

    $ cd pdfserver
    $ make deploy

To start a project around pdfserver run the following steps:

1. Create a new project::

    $ django-admin startproject myserver
  
2. Edit settings to fit pdfserver's needs (``myserver/settings.py``) following
   the example in ``example_settings.py``.

3. Create the database::

    $ python manage.py syncdb

4. Make sure the given upload directory is writable and not accessible from 
   outside.

5. When not in debug mode make sure to serve static files under ``media/js/*``
   and ``media/css/*``.
