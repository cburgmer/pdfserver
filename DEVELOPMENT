Translations
============
Create a new set of translations:
    $ pybabel extract -F babel.cfg -o messages.pot pdfserver
    $ pybabel init -i messages.pot -d pdfserver/translations -l en_GB

Re-examine all sources and update translations:
    $ pybabel update -i messages.pot -d pdfserver/translations

Compile catalogues:
    $ pybabel compile -d pdfserver/translations


Updating jQuery
===============
The necessary scripts of jQuery are packaged with this module. If you want to
update the scripts do::

    $ cd pdfserver

Edit the download links in ``Makefile``, and then::

    $ make deploy


Unittests
=========
For pdfserver unittests run::

    $ python setup.py test

The default configuration is set in such a way that celery is picked up by
default if the Python module is installed. To test against celery
integration, celeryd needs to be started in the background. Make sure both
get the exact same test settings. Also sqlite in-memory databases cannot be
shared between the webserver and the task handler.

To show coverage rendered as HTML install nose and coverage and run::

    $ nosetests pdfserver --with-coverage --cover-package pdfserver \
      --cover-html --cover-html-dir coverage

Then point your browser to ./coverage/index.html.
